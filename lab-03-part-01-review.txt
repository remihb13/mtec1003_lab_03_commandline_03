5. Delete these directories from your home folder by using this command:

$ rm -rf [name of directory/folder]

for example:

$ rm -rf mtec1003-labs-02

(skip if these directories don't exist)
----------
v314-ent-004:~ student$ $ rm -rf mtec1003
-bash: $: command not found
v314-ent-004:~ student$ rm mtec1003
rm: mtec1003: is a directory
v314-ent-004:~ student$ $ rm -rf mtec1003-labs-02
-bash: $: command not found


==========
6.  A compressed archive (.tar.gz) of the lab files can be found at this url: 

http://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Wilson-MTEC1003/labs/03/mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz

Download this file to your home directory into a file called mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz   

Use a command that we learned to do this.

This command should have a *flag* to specify the output file.  MAKE SURE TO NAME YOUR OUTPUT FILE: mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz

Write the command(s) that you used to download this file - as well as its output - below:
----------
v314-ent-004:~ student$ curl -o mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz http://entertainmenttechnology.github.io/Wilson-MTEC1003/labs/03/mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz

v314-ent-004:~ student$ unzip mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz
Archive:  mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz
  End-of-central-directory signature not found.  Either this file is not
  a zipfile, or it constitutes one disk of a multi-part archive.  In the
  latter case the central directory and zipfile comment will be found on
  the last disk(s) of this archive.
unzip:  cannot find zipfile directory in one of mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz or
        mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz.zip, and cannot find mtec1003-lab-03.tar.gz.ZIP, period.


==========
8.  You should now have a directory called mtec1003-lab-03 in your home directory.  Verify that this directory exists.

If the directory does not exist:

----------
v314-ent-004:mtec1003 student$ ls mtec1003
ls: mtec1003: No such file or directory
